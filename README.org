This will be an evolving tutorial, representing what I know, and
presumably at the end of the document, where I'm stuck.

There are at least two good spots to study om-next, the quick-start on
the wiki, and Tony Kay's devcards tutorial.  Even after reading/doing
those sources, I was still too confused to build anything.  This
document will outline where I'm still confused.
