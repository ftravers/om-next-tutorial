This will be an evolving tutorial, representing what I know, and
presumably at the end of the document, where I'm stuck.

There are at least two good spots to study om-next,
[the
quick-start](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next)) on the wiki, and
[Tony Kay's devcards tutorial](https://github.com/awkay/om-tutorial).
Even after reading/doing those sources, I was still too confused to
build anything.  This document will outline where I'm still confused.
